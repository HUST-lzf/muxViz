{"name":"muxViz","tagline":"Multilayer Analysis and Visualization of interconnected networks","body":"muxViz v0.1\r\n=========\r\n\r\nVisualization of interconnected multilayer networks\r\n\r\nmuxViz is a script for the visualization of interconnected multi-layer networks. It requires R v3.0.1 (or above) with the following packages installed:\r\n\r\n- igraph v0.6.5 (or above)\r\n- RGL 0.93.963 (or above)\r\n- mapproject v1.2-1 (or above)\r\n- openstreetmap v0.3.1 (or above)\r\n\r\nUsage within R environment:\r\n\r\n\tsource('muxViz.R')\r\n\t\r\nUsage from shell command line:\r\n\r\n\tR CMD BATCH muxViz.R\r\n\r\n\r\n![Network with community structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manlius/muxViz/master/gallery/muxViz_community3.png \"Network with community structure\")\r\n![Air transportation network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manlius/muxViz/master/gallery/muxViz_airports_osm6e.png \"Air transportation network\")\r\n![Real collaboration network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manlius/muxViz/master/gallery/muxViz_16Layers_Real2.png \"Collaboration network\")\r\n\r\nIf used with the default options for the first time, muxViz will plot a multiplex with 100 nodes and 4 layers with community-like topology. The output should be a file 'muxViz.png' in the same folder, similar to 'muxViz_example.png' provided with the package.\r\n\r\nPlease, explicitly cite muxViz if you find it useful for your visualizations.\r\n\r\n\r\nmonoxViz v0.1\r\n===========\r\n\r\nVisualization of classical single-layer networks\r\n\r\nThe muxViz package now includes a script for the visualization of standard networks. It supports both 2D and 3D layouting with openGL, it is fully integrated with OpenStreetMap and preserves all the features developed to customize visualizations with muxViz.\r\n\r\n![Network with community structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manlius/muxViz/master/gallery/monoxViz_community_example2.png \"Network with community structure\")\r\n![London Tube + OpenStreetMap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manlius/muxViz/master/gallery/monoxViz_london_tube.png \"London Tube + OpenStreetMap\")\r\n![Yeast genetic interaction network (GCC)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manlius/muxViz/master/gallery/monoxViz_yeast_interaction_lcc.png \"Yeast genetic interaction network (GCC)\")\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright\r\n=======\r\n\r\n(C) Copyright 2013, Manlio De Domenico.\r\n\r\nThis code has no warranty whatsoever and any kind of support is provided.\r\nYou are free to do what you like with this code as long as you leave this copyright in place.\r\nPlease, explicitly cite muxViz if you find it useful for your visualizations.\r\n\r\n(C) Copyright 2013, Manlio De Domenico (manlio.dedomenico at urv.cat) \r\n\r\nEach file in this folder is part of the muxViz package. \r\n\r\nmuxViz is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. \r\n\r\nmuxViz is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
